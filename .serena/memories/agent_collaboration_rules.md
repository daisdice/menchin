# Antigravity & Serena Collaboration Rules

- **Token Efficiency**: Antigravity should prioritize using Serena MCP tools (e.g., `mcp_read_memory`, `mcp_find_symbol`) for information retrieval instead of reading raw files or asking broad questions. This utilizes Serena's indexed knowledge and context management to reduce token usage in the main conversation window.
- **Memory First**: Always check existing memories in Serena before starting a new research task.
